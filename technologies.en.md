## Assistive technologies used for web browsing

Individuals living with a disability use assistive technologies such as the
following to enable and assist web browsing:

 * Screen reader software,<br/>
 which can read out, using synthesized speech, either
selected elements of what is being displayed on the monitor (helpful for users
with reading or learning difficulties), or which can read out everything that is
happening on the computer (used by blind and vision impaired users).
 * Braille terminals,<br/>
 consisting of a Refreshable Braille display which renders
text as Braille characters (usually by means of raising pegs through holes in a
flat surface) and either a mainstream keyboard or a Braille keyboard.
 * Screen magnification software,<br/>
 which enlarges what is displayed on the computer
monitor, making it easier to read for vision impaired users.
 * Speech recognition software<br/>
 that can accept spoken commands to the computer, or
turn dictation into grammatically correct text - useful for those who have
difficulty using a mouse or a keyboard.
 * Keyboard overlays,<br/>
 which can make typing easier and more accurate for those who
have motor control difficulties.
 * Access to subtitled or sign language videos on the Internet for all deaf people.
